# Genetic Algorithm

This project aims to implement a genetic algorithm in C++. The purpose of the algorithm is to solve binary optimization problems. It provides necessary interfaces for adding problems, although currently, it includes an example implementation for the Knapsack Problem.

## Features

- Genetic algorithm implementation for binary optimization problems.
- Interfaces for adding custom problems.
- Example implementation for the Knapsack Problem, as well as different test cases.
